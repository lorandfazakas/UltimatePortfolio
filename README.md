Ultimate Portfolio is a demo app that aims to showcase my experience building iOS apps.

The app itself provides an easy way of managing projects and items within it. This includes setting item completion, priority and even opening and closing projects.
It's designed with VoiceOver support in mind so it's accessible for everyone.


## Trying it yourself

UltimatePortfolio is written using Xcode 12.5 and Swift 5.1. You should be able to clone this and build it immediately by opening `UltimatePortfolio.xcodeproj`.
If you hit problems, either building or running the app, please let me know.
